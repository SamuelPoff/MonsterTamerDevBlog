            <h2>What is "Monster Tamer"</h2>
            <p>Monster Tamer is the (very creative) prototype name for a game I am developing! The game is basically: "What if I did open world pokemon but in 2D and actually tried to make
                the game more condusive to being open world". I (and surely many other pokemon-enjoyers) have been hungry for a true open-ended pokemon-like experience since childhood.
                While Game Freak has experimented with open-worldifying their games in recent years (The wild areas of Pokemon: Sword and Shield, Pokemon: Legends Arceus, Pokemon: Scarlet and Violet),
                every attempt has felt under-baked or under-realized in some way. All of the aforementioned games have suffered from techincal problems. From bugs and glitches, to atrocious frame drops
                and presentation issues. While I don't blame the skilled and passionate developers (who are more than likely under harsh time constraints) for these shortcomings, and assume one day
                Game Freak could deliver on such a premise; for now I figured: "If I have so much to say about the design of these games why don't I try to develop my ideas myself?" Thus my "Monster Tamer"
                project was born (again what an excellent name).
            </p>
            <p>The main goals?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>More thoughtfully intertwine open-world games' more exploration focused gameplay with the fun of exploring and discovering new monsters.</li>
                <li>Aiding in that goal: ensure all monsters have more than just uniqueness in battle. Give them all things they can do to aid in exploring and uncovering the world (and therefore new monsters).</li>
                <li>Have monsters behave slightly more realistically in the environment. At least more than how Pokemon just sit around in environments somewhat related to their type. Birds should fly up into trees,
                    aggressive monsters should attack the player, rodents may run to hide in tall grass, pack-based monsters actually stay in packs and use that to their advantage, etc. Programming these more complex behaviors
                    will be time-consuming to figure out, so it will be done within reason.
                </li>
                <li>Limit exploration enough to allow the player's exploration capabilities to grow naturally across the game. Many modern open world games give the player (in my opinion) too much
                    agency in exploring too soon into the game's runtime. This can lead to overwhelming certain types of players. By making certain areas easier to access than others, it can guide players who want a bit more direction, without stifling 
                    players that want the freedom to make mistakes and wander into areas out of their depth. My idea is to dial back easy traversal options in the early-game (while still allowing the player to go where they want), and then have exploration
                    become easier/faster/etc as the player tames more monsters and finds unique ways to utilize their abilities, without ever dipping into lock-and-key style design. 
                </li>
                <li>Maintain the fun aspect of team-building that any good monster tamer should have.</li>
                <li>Experiment with combat styles that compliment the more exploration focused gameplay, while still scratching that team-building itch.</li>
                <li>Do all of this in a 2D top-down game. Not only does this make the game easier to develop for me since I only have experience working on 2D games and making 2D art, but I think there is a special charm to 2D that
                    3D can't always quite replicate. So the game will act as an open 3D game, but presented through a top down 2D style. This means no wide open vistas to guide the player through the world,
                    so I will have to get more creative on sparking the player's itch to explore every inch of the world.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How am I developing this project</h2>
            <p>
                Currently I am the only person working on programming, and me and my girlfriend work on the art together. While I currently plan to continue developing
                the game this way, I wouldnt be opposed to having a few more people on board down the line. I chose to develop the game using the <a href="https://monogame.net/">Monogame framework</a>.
                I have used <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a>, <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a>, and <a href="https://gamemaker.io/en">Gamemaker Studio</a>, but have always wanted to learn more about the fundamentals of game programming. All of the aforementioned engines are great tools that I may
                even use in the future, but they all abstract away many of the technical fundamentals that I personally want to master before using a higher level tool. However, I still want to make a game, not just an engine,
                so I compromised on Monogame. It will provide just enough for me to not get bogged down in OS-specific code for graphics, input, audio, etc and help me build for multiple platforms. But it will also
                leave all the of structuring and tooling to me, which as someone who wants to gain a strong fundamental understanding of game programming sounds like just enough. After all I've gotten a rainbow triangle to render
                using OpenGL, DirectX, and Vulklan so I'm basically already an expert and should skip all that low-level graphics stuff (that was a joke btw please don't come for me lol). In short: I want to make a game, yes; I also want to
                build my skills so that I'm creatively hindered by my technical ability as little as possible, and so that I can be a competent general programmer, not just a GameMaker or Godot expert. That being said it is not my intention to
                belittle developers who chose to stick to commercial engines, it is most definitly a difficult skill to master and one I may dabble in down the line once I scratch my own itch for lower level knowledge.
            </p>

            <p>
                The art is currently being drawn using photoshop, but I am no expert in cranking out art as efficiently as possible so the art workflow is likely to evolve. Initially the game was being designed
                around pixel art since its an artform I already knew how to do at a basic level. However, after some consideration, I'm moving away from pixel art since there are so many pixel art indie games
                out there, and I wanted to try my hand at learning more hand drawn art. I want to take the art direction to a space that is hand drawn but clearly inspired by the chunkiness and limitations
                that pixel art had. (Insert picture of pixel art next to a handdrawn interpretation of it).
