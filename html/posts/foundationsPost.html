            <h1>Foundations</h1>
            <p>
                As mentioned in the first post of this blog, the first few posts would be 100% retrospective. It has been many months since I worked on a lot of the early parts of the
                project but decisions I made early on are important for several reasons. First, since one of my goals was to make the blog slightly educational it would feel wrong
                to ignore the extremely important beginning phase of the project when I had a completely blank canvas. For a lot of first-time or inexperienced developers (and probably even experienced) that can be one of the 
                hardest things about starting and so I want to discuss my thought process for that (Not to say I'm uber-experienced but I have had a lot of trouble with just starting in the past). 
                Second, it would be nearly impossible to discuss any of the things I have been working on recently without giving a fairly detailed explaination of where the project came from 
                in the past. Last, there are some unique core ideas to how I wanted to build the game and to make the reading of the blog more cohesive, I want to at least introduce those topics
                early on so that I don't need to make a ton of asides to provide context. Some of those topics will probably get their own posts but in this one I'm going to shotgun some important
                points.

            <h3>Monogame</h3>
            <p>
                In the <a href="../about.html">About</a> page for this blog I discussed my reasoning behind using Monogame to build the project so if you're curious about my thoughts on that I would point you over
                that way. However, not everyone is familiar with Monogame so instead of explaining myself again I'll use this space to give more context into what Monogame is and what it looks like
                to use in practice. <br> Monogame is sort of a continuation of the old XNA framework used back in the days of Xbox Live Arcade. As a result of that a lot of XNA tutorials can
                be largely applied to Monogame when trying to find solutions or fix problems. Now it is maintained by the community and has no affiliation with Microsoft (as far as I know). Monogame
                runs using the .Net ecosystem which for me means using C# although I believe it works with F# and Visual Basic as well. Monogame is a <i>framework</i> not an engine, even though you may find it
                recommended when searching "Best game engines for 2D development" or something similar. This means it has no editor for scenes, no editor for anything actually, no out-of-the-box game object scripting system,
                etc. Monogame has few opinions on how things should be done. Its biggest weaknesses are also it biggest strengths however. Having no built in editor leaves you open to using whatever tools
                you want, or lets you make your own editor. Having no game object scripting means you can organize your game code however you would like, including setting up a scripting system from scratch if you would
                like. For me it helps cross the boundary from "knowing Unity" or "knowing Game Maker" (valuable skills mind you) to "knowing game programming" or just "programming" as a more fundamental skill.
                This is more in-line with what I want for myself at a personal level.
