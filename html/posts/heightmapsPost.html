            <h1>Heightmaps</h1>
            <p>
                As promised, the next post is going to explain one of the core foundations of the game: Heightmaps. With the game consisting of 2D sprites and visuals,
                but a world that simulates 3D space, a heightmap is a very simple way of representing the terrain data for the world. In this case the heightmap will be
                represented by instances of a Heightmap class. Since this post is written after the fact, I could just show the end result but that would be boring and unhelpful.
                So instead I'll run through some of my main considerations for the design of the heightmap as if I was coding it from scratch to show what the process looked like when I
                was making it. First, however, I need to explain a bit more about how I intend for this to coalesce into an actual game world.
            </p>

            <h3>How a Heightmap Will Represent the World</h3>
            <p>
                The heightmap at its core will just be a 2D map of cells, with each cell having a value representing how far from the "base" ground level that cell is up.
            </p>

                <figcaption>Diagram of how to visualize a heightmap for the game.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                As with anything, a MSPaint diagram must be drawn before moving forward. I don't make the rules. This example 4x4 heightmap shows a very small example of how this data
                can be visualized into something that could maybe resemble an old tile based game. In this example to emphasize the depth I didn't align the final heights with the
                grid. In actuality, in the context of the game it would be more accurate to visualize it like this:
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="../../assets/heightmapDiagram2.jpg" >
                <figcaption>Visualization showing grid alignment.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                By pointing out the importance of the grid-alignment, that may have also clued you in that this can be rendered in game with a tilemap. Obviously the heightmap itself
                will never be drawn (other than for debugging purposes if needed), so a complimentary map, the tilemap, will be made corresponding to the heightmap. This may ring alarm bells
                though, since a change in the heightmap would then require potentially large changes in the tilemap. This will create a work-flow nightmare right? If I was to construct these 
                from scratch every time then yeah, it would be scary to make any change to a heightmap once I have started mapping a tilemap over it. Thats why tooling will be so crucial.
                I'll need to create (and actually as of the time of writing this, have nearly finished) tools for automating parts of constructing these maps. A heightmap creation tool that
                will be able to use a tileset and auto generate a base terrain tilemap of the heightmap. After, I'll be able to add handmade touches to the map. Ideally, if changes
                occur to the heightmap I'll be able to write code that can isolate affected sections of the tilemap and auto generate just those sections again. This isn't about 
                tooling though so I'll pick that discussion up again some other time.
            </p>

            <h3>Design/Architecture Considerations</h3>
            <p>
                At the time of originally making this, the game had very few systems in place. For me that meant I could construct this almost any way I wanted to. I could use
                object-oriented features like classes, inheritance, polymorphism. Or I could opt for a more procedural style, making my code structure more similar to a C project. 
                <b>OR</b> I could begin moving the project toward a data oriented design, after all I'm at the beginning of my project so the precedent I set here could decide what
                patterns I continue to use in the future. I chose to not really hard commit to any of these in particular which is a weak answer, but since it was the beginning of my
                project I had no clue which design style would benefit my project the most. C# is a language with object oriented features and it pushes them on you pretty heavily.
                However this doesn't mean all of the design <b>has</b> to follow OOP to the letter. After all a lot of OOP's strengths come from its organization and encapsulation, which 
                shines the best when its used on a team. I'm coding by myself, however, so a lot of those benefits wouldn't exactly mean a <i>ton</i> for me. However, data oriented 
                design (which I'm going to call DoD from now on) would be somewhat difficult to fully achieve too since C# is garbage collected. C# has tools for memory management but 
                it goes so against the core fundamentals of the language I would've been better off using C++ if I wanted to <i>really</i> commit to that. So I landed on just kind of 
                hacking some stuff together to see if a paradigm emerged from what was easiest to implement. 
            </p>

            <p>
                So all of that is to say: I'm using C# a language with many object oriented features, but that doesn't mean my design has to be fully object <b>oriented</b>. Instead I suppose its object 
                <b>utilizing</b>. I want to do this as experiment to see if this design style is faster to develop/more efficient for the game's performance. If it ends poorly, it will be
                a great lesson learned in how not to architect software (or at least how not to architect a Monogame project). With all that out of the way lets continue on!
            </p>

            <h3>Heightmap class</h3>
            <p>
                As said earlier, the heightmap will be represented by instances of a class. In C# this is the most standard way of doing things, so nothing crazy here. There are other 
                options technically though: I could make a static singleton class that hangs around in global space. This would make accessing the heightmap very easy but could
                lead to difficulty tracking bugs. As for a pro, to use this structure for the heightmap would mean that all that would need to be done is to overwrite the static heightmap's data
                whenever I would've created a new heightmap instance which could technically be more performant, its less initialization code running, and less garbage collection. However, the
                cons here massively outweigh the pros. Heightmaps are going to be initialized very infrequently, meaning those "pros" would amount to basically nothing for 99% of the game's runtime.
                So trading harder code to debug, in this case, is not even close to worth it. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Well I have a blank (non-static) class ready to go now. So the first thing to do is figure out what data needs to be represented by this class. Key points are
                the map size (width,height/columns,rows), and an array of the actual heights.
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="../../assets/heightmapCodeSample1.JPG" >
                <figcaption>Basic Heightmap implementation (recreation, I dont have the original code I'm sorry)</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                An array was chosen here because of its lookup time efficiency. For physics calculations a lot of arbitrary positions in the array will need to be read, and games need all
                the performance they can get so an array will be perfect here. It is not a 2D array because after a little research on Google, I found that apparently 2D arrays are slightly slower
                to traverse and lookup as opposed to 1D arrays in C#. If had a ton of time I would've checked this fact myself on my machine but its a minor point so I decided to take the internet's word
                for it. Since a 2D map is being represented by a 1D array a simple indexing system will be worked out. In this case the top right of the map will correspond to index 0, and 
                the position on the map will follow to the right and down (like reading a book) as indicies increase. I'll add a quick couple utility methods to simplify this logic:
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="../../assets/heightmapCodeSample2.JPG" >
                <figcaption>Added utility methods to the bottom of the class</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                Comments will be omitted from most code snippets to save space, but in this case I would have included a quick comment since it might not be instanty obvious
                what these methods mean or how they work. In short: the GetIndexFromCoord(int column, int row) method takes a coord in the map and does some math to give the 
                index into the 1D array that coord represents. The other two methods do the reverse: they take an index into the 1D array and do some math to return
                the column and row respectively.
            </p>

            <p>
                So this class is in an extremly simple form, but it technically has all the data it needs. It's missing protections for invalid parameters, clear ways of accessing 
                the important data, and like tests? maybe? I don't plan on writing automated tests for this super simple data structure (at least not yet) so first I'll add ways to
                clearly access the important data. Following some basic OOP encapsulation principles, I limit the scope of getters and setters to the minimum they can be while still functioning. 
                I used C# properties for the Columns and Rows fields since they will have cookie-cutter accessors. First I'll change HeightData to a property like the other two in case it will be better for another section of code to get the raw array. 
                Then I write another method for getting individual values from the array in a more encapsulated manner with some consideration for invalid parameters. Not all invalid parameters
                need to always be handled, however, since sometimes the most helpful way of catching bugs during develoment can be for those invalid parameters to sneak in and cause the game
                to crash, then its VERY obvious where the problem came from. Since it would have to be a mistake on my part if an invalid column or row was passed in, I choose not to handle
                this error and let the game crash here if something goes wrong (by throwing an unhandled exception) (also obviously don't let things like this through to the final release). 
            </p>

                <figcaption>HeightData changed to a property, GetHeightData(int column, int row) added.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                Obviously this doesn't follow encapsulation super strictly, but in this early stage I know I will need to be able to inspect the raw HeightData array in several other
                sections of code and wanted to make that as straightforward as possible. This does leave the risk open of me misusing this level of access somewhere in the codebase, but
                since I am the only one working on this project I will have the divine knowledge of knowing not to do that, if I was working with others I would potentially take a different
                approach here. In short: I know this doesn't follow encasulation to the letter but I've thought about the tradeoffs and decided they are worth it (later I'll get to see
                if it <i>actually</i> works out).
            </p>

            <p>
                I could stop the heightmap class here if I wanted to. It checks all the boxes:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Contains map size data</li>
                <li>Contains the actual height data in an efficient manner</li>
                <li>Provides a simple interface for accessing that data</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                And this would be great if I already had other systems to load heightmaps, fill out their data, etc. But I am starting from nothing so this heightmap is going
                to end up needing a lot more than this in the end. It will need an interface together for mocking up data for testing, loading data from files, and probably a 
                bunch of other odds and ends that will only become obvious once I <i>need</i> a certain feature from the interface. So instead of trying to predict the future, I
                will leave the heightmap here in its simple form, ready to be expanded upon as it becomes <b>actually</b> clear what I need it to do <b>exactly</b>. Now this was written
                after the fact, so I already know many of the future changes I end up doing to this heightmap class. But this post is supposed to be a breif introduction to the topic of
                Heightmaps and my thought process around starting to make one from scratch, so I'll leave it there.
